Working with API

Geting a list of articles from the following api endpoint:
http://www.genfkd.org/?rest_route=/wp/v2/posts

Then building a list that consists of the titles of the articles that I received in the previous step.

Clicking the article title should open a modal window (pop up) with the article content.
Also adding a loading message or animation before articles get fully loaded.
