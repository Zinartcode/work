Smartphones, broadband internet, and video chatting are bringing people together in ways that were impossibly futuristic to previous generations. Our generation has grown up with the first generation of home media such as VHS and DVD and has come of age in time to experience the rise of streaming sites like Netflix and Hulu, a library of media reaching decades into the past, accessible at the click of a mouse. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a way, the \u2018wrong generation\u2019 ennui experienced by millennials is a luxury brought about by the prevalence of online streaming such as Youtube and Netflix, which give us faster and easier access to previous generations\u2019 media than they had to their own predecessors. Kids in the 70s couldn\u2019t have fed a longing for a 40s aesthetic and music unless they sought it out at secondhand shops and record stores, but now we can stream all the 50s music, art and movies we like to our personal computers in seconds. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only would millennials not want to shed the conveniences of modern tech given the opportunity, but were they to, they would lose their impetus to do so. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Viewing the past through rose-colored glasses<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we remember the past, we tend to pick and choose the elements that we want to focus on, like music or cultural movements or dance crazes.

When people think about living in another generation, they think about experiencing it from the best socio-political circumstances, which is missing the forest for the trees. It\u2019s always great to experience life at the top of the socio-political pyramid, but few people ever do, and their experiences aren\u2019t reflective of what it\u2019s like to live in that period.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Takeaway<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While contemporary times may feel like something of a raging <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4627056\/dumpster-fire-2016-word-of-the-year\/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http:\/\/time.com\/4627056\/dumpster-fire-2016-word-of-the-year\/', 'dumpster fire');\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dumpster fire<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to some, it\u2019s important to remember that quality of life has never been better across the board for a greater cross-section of humanity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daydreaming about seeing your favorite band perform live in their prime or living in a time period when your favorite things were on-trend is an idyllic, yet dangerously short-sighted, idea.

Students are taught that they must get good SAT or ACT scores and go to college, and they must do so despite the financial price in order to ensure a prosperous future. But at what cost?

Is the cost of a degree worth the student debt, and why has voting not maintained its urgency?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Priorities within this country need to be re-examined. A degree is worth something, but not the amount of debt that we become enslaved to. Voting is a privilege and our job as U.S. citizens. No student should ever feel swayed to give up that privilege in order to have their mounds of debt disappear.<\/p>\n<p><em>Have something to add to this story?

Then, after finally making the leap by quitting the job or the situation in which they feel trapped, the person enters into a time-out period to rediscover themselves.

Memes thrive on recognition, so as long as companies choose carefully, using memes is a smart marketing tool that can serve to attract millennial buyers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, like any form of advertisement, companies must choose how they use memes, since they could have the opposite effect and make companies seem like they are trying too hard to appeal to millennials.

Half of the workplace is made up of women, but working on their issues is difficult in male-dominated spaces. Dr. Trenace Richardson created REAL Women as a way for women to be able to work on themselves in a safe space.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">REAL Women started from Richardson\u2019s own experiences \u2014 feeling burned out at work, she wanted a way to be able to work on herself. She wanted a space where she could be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.trenacerichardson.com\/realwomen\" onclick=\"__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https:\/\/www.trenacerichardson.com\/realwomen', 'transparent');\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">transparent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so she could confront her own issues along with other women. These workshops let women open up about what\u2019s happening inside themselves, what\u2019s bothering them or whatever they want to talk about with other women. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Richardson is a speaker, preacher, and mentor to women. She received a Master\u2019s of Divinity from Howard University and a doctorate in Higher Education Administration from The George Washington University. Her faith guides her work, which includes formerly working in executive church leadership and writing on spirituality in the workplace.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Takeaway<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Women deal with more issues than men in the workplace and other areas of life. In order to confront these issues with other women, safe spaces are needed. The safe spaces allow women to open up about their experiences in an understanding environment with other women. REAL Women is a place where women can do this without fear of judgment or retribution, where women can go to seek empowerment.<\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have something to add to this story?

Are there enough new features in the iPhone X to justify the $300 increase? The original iPhone came with a 2-megapixel camera, a storage capacity of 4, 8 or 16 GB, a 3.5\u201d and a 320&#215;480 display. The iPhone X will come with a 12-megapixel camera, a storage capacity of 64 or 256 GB, a 5.8\u201d and a 1124&#215;2436 display, not to mention the large bevy of features added through the years and for this new model.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Just comparing the two phones, the changes are staggering. The improvements to the new iPhone are so extensive that they hardly compare to the iPhone it replaced. New features added after the first release include the front-facing camera, Siri, multitasking, third-party apps, iMessage, etc. The original iPhone couldn\u2019t even copy and paste text. Advancements in technology have rapidly increased the capabilities of iPhones, with more and more being added with each release. So $300 may not seem like much when you look at what both of the phones have to offer.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Takeaway: The price hike is justified with the new additions<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to see the progression of the iPhone without just thinking about the current model. Apple\u2019s original release didn\u2019t have a lot of the key features that are synonymous with the iPhone today. When they were originally released, iPhones were a breath of fresh air. The invention was a bold attempt to take on established smartphone companies and show that things could be improved.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ten years later, Apple is currently <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2017\/08\/02\/idc-smartphone-shipments-fell-1-3-in-q2-2017-but-samsung-apple-huawei-oppo-and-xiaomi-all-gained-share\/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2017\/08\/02\/idc-smartphone-shipments-fell-1-3-in-q2-2017-but-samsung-apple-huawei-oppo-and-xiaomi-all-gained-share\/', 'second');\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">second<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in market share of the smartphone market.
